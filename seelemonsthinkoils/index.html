    <p>This is a website that I built for my wife and one of my favorite projects. I had the rare opportunity to work with my wife and use my skills to help her.</p>
    <p>This is a static website, which means that it is a collection of HTML files that are saved to the server and updated by me when she needs changes.</p>
    <p>I was able to combine my skills as a graphical artist to create an animated essential oil bottle, and logo.</p>
