        NorthStar Baptist Church is a small church located in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho. This website utilizes <a href="http://wolfcms.org/" target="_blank">WolfCMS</a> on the back end which allows the editors to log into an administration area and make changes to the page content, add new pages, and upload and manage files and images.
    </p>
    <p>
        The PHP framework of WolfCMS allows me, as the developer more flexibility to create the page layout that the client wants rather than being restricted to a theme such as you would see with other content management systems such as <a href="https://wordpress.org/" target="_blank">WordPress</a>.
